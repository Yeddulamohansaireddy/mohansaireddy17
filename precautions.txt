Potato___Early_blight@@Use disease-free seed potatoes. Keep cull/compost piles away from potato growing areas. Destroy any volunteer potato plants. Keep tubers covered with soil throughout the season to prevent tuber infection. Remove infected tubers before storing to prevent the spread of disease in storage. Kill vines completely before harvest to avoid inoculation of the tubers during harvest. Resistant varieties are available, although some fungicides must still be applied to resistant cultivars. See current recommendations for chemical control measures.
